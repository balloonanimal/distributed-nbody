As we have it right now the code is buildable and runnable. To build, cd into
the source directory and run make. This will make both the library and the two
currenly written experiment files. The files are benchmark and benchmark_mpi.
The experiments both have the signature [n_bodies] [steps].
===========
./benchmark 100 10000
===========
Will run a particle-particle based simulation of 100 particles for 10000
time steps. The MPI based implementation can be run
===========
mpirun -np 4 --hostfile hostfilebig ./benchmark_mpi 100 10000
===========

This was our schedule:
Week 1: Implement the naive algorithm in C++ by Tuesday
  April 14th. Additionally, contact Danner and begin discussion of visualization
  possibilities. Create a presentation document and make note of the steps we've
  made thus far in it.
Week 2: Implement the Barnes-Hut tree algorithm by
  Tuesday April 21st. Finalize decisions about visualization. Determine which
  metrics we will use for testing, and begin implementing testing code. Update
  presentation.
Week 3: Deal with problems that may still linger in our
  solutions. Begin large-scale testing and data collection. Ensure data
  visualization is functioning. If additional time remains, add additional
  functionality (see \ref{soln}). By April 28th.
Week 4: Finish testing and data
  collection, including at least one very large $N$ run. Analyze runtime
  measurements. Finalize any visualizations which still require attention, and
  determine which visualizations to use in the presentation. Compile analysis
  into presentation. Finish working on presentation by when we present on May
  13th.


As it stands currently, at the end of the project work week, we 
have implemented both a naive (ie sequential and paritical-particale 
force calculation) working solution, and an algorithmically simple 
MPI implementation. Primarily, then
the largest source-code component still requiring oto be implemented is 
the Barnes-Hut algorithm for more effeciently calculating the forces
the particless exert on each other. While we were not explicit about the 
sequential/MPI distinction during our initial schedule, we get the impression
that are we slightly ahead of schedule in terms of code implementation. 

For the other half of the project, namely running large tests and creating a good
method for visualizing the results from our program's runs, we have been 
a little less proactive. While we have done some modest runs and visually
inspected the output for generally correct tendencies, we have not made
much headway toward representing the output in a pleasent and easy to 
interpret manner. To ammend our initial schedule, we will be emailing
Professor Danner at the beginning of week two, as well as trying out the
static plotting of our program's output -- this has been our base-level plan 
for visualization, but one which we need to actually confirm is as easy as we
anticipate. We will also start preparing our presentation in earnest in the
coming week, additionally aided by our mid-project presentation which we are
preparing this weekend for our scheduled presentation on Tuesday. Due to the
further than anticipated state of our code, we are not partically worried
about the ability to meet our other goals on schedule -- rather, we will 
shift the amount of relative time we are spending on running tests and writing
up our project vs getting the implementation to run.

PROMPT
==========================
Tell me whether your code is build-able and runnable, and if so how to do
both (command line examples). A list of your project plan from your project
proposal that is annotated with notes about which parts of your plan you
accomplished this week; tell me what you did this week, tell me what new
parts were implemented, what new parts tested, etc. You may have an altered
project plan from the one you submitted with your proposal, which is fine.
Use the project plan that best fits your project now.

Annotate your plan with which group member was responsible for completing
different parts, and which are responsible for future parts. If some were
worked on by more than one of you, include both/all of you in the annotation
for that task.

You should have more details filled out than from your proposal plan that
reflect what you have done and what changes you have made to your next
steps.
