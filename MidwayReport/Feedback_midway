Talk feedback for Group 2. Brendan, Gus, Zach

Two parts to this feedback on your midway project report:

  A. anonymized feedback from your classmate
  B. my feedback with more verbose comments about parts
     of your presentation

---------------------------------------------------------
 A. feedback from your classmates about your presentation
---------------------------------------------------------

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well 
I liked all the images and videos explaining the problem, it made the problem
very clear

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve I found the
   description of the Barns-Hutt algorithm somewhat confusing

---

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  
       - I appreciated the introduction to the physics material in 
	 this presentation. It was really cool and not too hard to
	 follow!

       - Clear roadmap of presentation!

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve
       - I think when you're talking about the potential problems, 
	 if you have a slide describing each of the ideas, so
	 that it makes it a bit easier to follow each of the 
	 specifics.

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  
	- use of the video really helped visualize
	- nice structure throughout presentation
	- great answers to questions that added to presentation 

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve
	- The chosen theme for the slides are a little distracting, a
	  cleaner design might make the points you're making clearer 
	- Explain the problem itself a little more before talking about
	  approaches. Most of us aren't familiar with the problem and don't
	  completely understand the challenges of it.

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  
	They did a good job of walking us through their project progress
	and what is left to do.

   2.  At least one thing on which the group could improve
	Maybe describe the problem a bit more. I didn't really understand the
	Barnes-Hutt tree algorithm part. 
---

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well
It's an interesting problem and they've already done a lot of work on it.

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve
Talk more about previous successes with parallel hutts algorithm.

---

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  
	Interesting problem, explained the problem and results so far well

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve
	Could talk about evaluation or related work more

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  
      
       Great explanation and discussion of the potential problems and
       challenges of parallel implementation of Barnes-Hut Algorithm. They were
       very clear and specific with the potential difficulties of implementing
       the algorithm. 

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve

      Maybe it might have been interesting to provide a little more detail as
      to how the problem is modeled (physically)  and how certain values are
      computed, but overall, well presented. 

---

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  
	Use of the video is really great to help visualize the problem

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve
        (Could have been too in-depth for this presentation) but more
        information on incorporating MPI would be useful - specifically how
        it's used, how many messages each process sends/receives, why it was
        chosen for the parallelization step (versus other, non-message based
        parallelization), and some sort of visualization of the communication
        hierarchy

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well 
	> I liked the creativity with the slides - it was original and engaging
	without being distracting. 
        > The videos were also a very useful way to quickly explain and
        visualize the problem. 


   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve
      > Maybe splitting parts more evenly? It seemed as though one person spoke
	significantly longer than the other two. The same went for who was 	
	primarily answering questions.

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  
        The group presented their progress and challenges very well. This part
        helped me understand the n-body problem on a general level although I
        have little background in astrophysics. Kudos to group 2 for doing a
        Type 1 project.

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve
	It'd be nice if the presentation was split more evenly among members.

Parallelizing n-body problem
  predicting movement of n objects interacting through gravity
  Important to astrophysics

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well

   Visual presentations provided a clear, literal, image of the problem
   making it easier to understand and provided the equations used in Barnes-Hut
   Algorithm. Also provided details of progress made, steps needed to be taken,
   and issues currently faced.

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve

   It would be nice to see output outside of just operation run time but
   considering current constraints (us being at home) its only a minor issue

---
   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  

   Great slide design and introduction of the problem, motivation, methods,
   and achievements thus far. 

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve

   It would have been great to see a little pseudocode, or some form of their 
   implementation, visualization of data structures (such as the tree that was 
   mentioned) and output, or results since this is a type 1 project.
---

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  
-interesting topic, very well summarized/presented for people with little
background
   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve
-how do you know if you have been successful? I would like to know a little bit
more about this because it wasn't covered very well in the presentation

---
1. What was at least one thing that the group did well

They did a good job explaining the issues and things to consider for their
project.

2. At least one thing on which the group could improve

I think it would be interesting if they talked about why this problem is
important/what it can be used for, or why they chose it.

 B. my feedback on your presentation
--------------------------------------------------------------

Q: do these bodies merge when collide or bounce off each other?
Q: in O(n2) alg is each body a process in parallel?  or does 
   each process gets N/P bodies?

* nobody problem intro 
  * a figure here would be helpful to understand n-body problem, slower
  * videos are nice to explain

* how to simulate
  * define terms in function more, xii are what? ...
  * maybe a figure of this commutation would help  (

* how to efficiently simulate?
  * say barnes hutt, but add this to slide

* show picture of barnes hutt tree for an example
  * in final presentation go through more detail of how parallelize
    dividing space? or deciding particles?
  * be more clear about what is being parallelized over: space or particles?
    and how is different from what is being paralleized over for n^2 algorithm

* MPI does each particle a different process on MPI or each process is 
  set of processes
  * step through with figure this algorithm more in final presentation

* Issues difficulties discussion good

  ** think about duplicating the top of the tree on every node to reduce 
     communication/interaction with a single master  (this may be a
     future work)

* TODO
  
  * good set of issues, clearly described


1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  

       * good logical presentation 
       * nice use of videos illustrating algorithms
       * nice answering of Qs

2. At least one thing on which the group could improve

       * more examples to explain algorithm in presentation for understanding
         of algorithms for solving both the N2 and barnes hutt
       * be more clear about what parallelizing over for each
       * split up presentation a bit more evenly among the three of you
